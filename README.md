# Advent of Code 2015


My attempt at going back in time and trying the Advent of Code challenges that were released in 2015!

Interestingly Rust was released for production use in May 2015, so the timing is very similar between AOC first being released in
2015 and also Rust having a production ready version being released (although I'm sure it is just a coincidence).
